I wanted to create a "Mega Alien" that was harder for players to defeat. I did this by making a new class MegaAlien that is a subclass of Alien and thus shares the same attributes. MegaAlien has one new attribute different from Alien, and that is _lives. _lives attribute. MegaAlien also has a special source (just alien3.png flipped upside down and turned pink, called alien5.png in Images folder). I had to account for the correct depletion of lives for the mega alien vs the normal alien, so in my aliencollision method, I check to see if an alien in self._aliens is a mega alien and determine if that mega alien has any lives left. If it is out of lives, the mega alien is deleted, but if it still has lives, it remains on the screen.

I also decided to speed up the aliens each time an alien is defeated. I did this by creating a new attribute, _speeder, that keeps track of the variable that ALIEN_SPEED should be multiplied by. I initialized _speeder as 1.0 and multiplied it by 0.97 every time an alien was defeated (in aliencollision). I multiplied ALIEN_SPEED by _speeder in my movealiens method so that the aliens will move faster after an alien is defeated.
